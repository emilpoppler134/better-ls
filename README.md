# A better alternative to the ls command
This project is quite straightforward; it's a C program that loops through the current or any given directory and gets its content. It then runs a "quicksort" based on type, extension, etc. "Quckisort" is one of the fastest sorting algortims and it isn't too complicated for a small project like this. It then works with a hash map to identify the appropriate icon based on the file extension.

## Requirements
- A unix based os
- Nerd font
